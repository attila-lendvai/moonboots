lua binding policy:
 - every measure is in its natural unit, e.g. time in seconds
 - functions and variables are never renamed (not even DelayMS, even though it accepts seconds). obvious prefixes are removed.
 - functions rise lua errors, unless return codes are part of normal usage (e.g. Wls_CheckNetLink)


broken:
 - on pc1000 string format using %f
